= Meta-Metamodel Goal and Scope
:toc: preamble

This document describe different goals and scope of the Meta-Metamodel to be used by LionWeb.

== Goals
The core question is: "What is the goal of the lionweb meta-metamodel?"

There are multiple goals that we can think of.
Two of the main goals that we can distinguish are as follows:

=== Goal 1: Data Interchange Meta-Metamodel
The goal of the meta-metamodel is to define a meta-language with which to conveniently describe the structure of the model data that is produced and consumed by the LionWeb API.
This structure is described using node types (concepts), node properties (features) and node links (containment and references).
This is similar to a schema for e.g. XML or JSON as it is programming language agnostic.

Also see issue https://github.com/LIonWeb-org/organization/issues/61

=== Goal 2: Programming Meta-Metamodel
The goal of the meta-metamodel is to define a meta-language with which to describe a programming interface to a model,
which can be used in programming languages like TypeScript, C#, Java, Python, etc..

A Programming Meta-Metamodel is usually more elaborate that a Data Interchange Metamodel,
as there are more concerns that need to be taken into account in programming.

=== Examples
This sections show several examples of discussions that depend on the chosen goal.

==== Example: Derived Feature
A derived feature is interesting for a Programming Meta-Metamodel, where access to derived properties can be defined by a derivation function.
This way interfaces to objects(nodes) can be unified making them easier to program against.

For example, the  <<conceptinterface#ex-mix-decl-ref, Mix declarations and references>> is a typical case relevant for a Programming Meta-Metamodel.
For the Model Interchange Meta-Metamodel, this case is irrelevant, as the derived features simply will not be in the model data.

The same holds for <<conceptinterface#ex-set-name, Set name of all named things>>.

Also see https://github.com/LIonWeb-org/organization/issues/16[Have a default way to manage derived properties of nodes]

==== Example Date Primitive
If Date is a primitive type in the Meta-Metamodel, then a standard annotations like `java:Date` is relevant to a Programming Meta-Metamodel,
as this makes a statement about how the Data type can (should?/must?) be implemented in Java.

For a Data Interchange Meta-Metamodel this annotation is not relevant as this is programming language independent.
From this point of view it does make sense to define e.g. that a Date property value will always be a string in the ISO 8601 format.
When using a LionWeb compliant server, clients should then expect such a format and ensure that a Date sent is in this format.
Clients are free how to implement this in their programming language, but this is not part of the Data Interchange Meta-Metamodel.

== LionWeb Goal Discussion

LionWeb has several goals.

1. LionWeb provides one or more APIs that support interoperability of models on the web.
   Such a model is an instance of a language (let's call it L) that has been defined by a language engineer.
2. LionWeb is *open*, allowing any client to use it.
   Client are free to be implemented any way they like, as long aas the use the LionWeb APIs for external communication.

Currently, we have identified the following APIs:
- a repository access API for storing and retrieving models (or submodels)
- a delta API that allows subscription to model changes
- more... ?

The Data Interchange Meta-Metamodel supports describing the model data that is used (produced or consumed) by these APIs.
Therefore, a Data Interchange Meta-Metamodel is enough to support the goal of LionWeb.

The Programming Meta-Metamodel supports the LionWeb goals as well.
However, a Programming Meta-Metamodel also specifies implementation constraints about the way a client (of the API) should represent models.
This goes beyond the goal for LionWeb, as LionWeb only specifies APIs.

Furthermore, the more LionWeb prescribes how clients need to be implemented, the less "open" it becomes.
For LionWeb to be fully open, clients should have complete freedom to represent and process models the way they see fit.

The internal representation of a model within a (client) tool has no consequences for the interoperability of the tool.
The only things that a tool must have to be interoperable are:

- Being able to consume a (sub)model from a LionWeb API.
  Typically, this means that the tool will have a mapping from the JSON model provided by the LionWeb APi to its internal structure.
- Being able to send a (sub)model to LionWeb conforming to the defined LionWeb structure.
  Typically, this means that the tool will have a mapping from its internal structure to the JSON model provided
  by the LionWeb API.

== Example Client
In a project I am currently working on, we have a client whose only purpose is to interpret expression in a model.
For this client, we do not have any classes or interfaces, nor do we have inheritance or interface implementations.
Technically we simply take the JSON of the model *as-is* in TypeScript and provide TypeScript Types for each node on top of it.
For the purpose of the interpreter, this works perfectly well.

If the interpreter used LionWeb with a Programming Meta-Metamodel, the current implementation would be non-compliant.
Which makes no sense, as the internal representation of the interpreter is irrelevant to its interoperability.

== Conclusion
Following the LionWeb goals of interoperability and being open we should define a Data Interchange Meta-Metamodel, not a Programming Meta-Metamodel.

Things would work more-or-less as shown in the following picture:

== Having Said This ...

=== Programming Support
To make it easy for developers / language engineers to build clients using the LionWeb API, it can be very useful
to provide implementations of model representations for various languages.

For example, we can a provide tool that generates TypeScript/Java classes and interfaces,
including (de)serialization code, for a language defined by a Metamodel specified using the LionWeb Meta-Metamodel.

This would be very similar to the various existing (and popular) tools that generate e.g. Java classes from an XML
Schema or a JSON schema.
However, these tools don't need to be part of the LionWeb specification, but can be provided as separate (optional)
supporting tools.
People using existing language workbenches (MPS, EMF, Freon, ...) will probably ignore these tools and create their
own mapping from/to their own specific metamodels.
But people who are creating new tools connecting into a LionWeb environment will most likely simply use the tools provided.

An alternative is to provide a LionWeb specification for those language specific implementations,
but this specification is client specific and is at a very different level of interoperability.
This defined client *intra*-operability instead of *inter*-operability.
An important question is whether we want to include this in the LionWeb scope.
If we decide to include this, it should at least be done as a separate compliance point.

Even then it should probably just be a very lean 1-to-1 mapping from the Data Interchange Metamodel,
This is along the lines of what Federico suggests in the slack channel (@Federico: correct me if I am wrong):
_"I would lean toward having very lean Java/TS interfaces for things
like navigating trees, observing them, serializing them, and validating them."_.
I would find observing and validating already more than lean.

=== Language Specific Questions
Note that if we decide to provide language implementations (or just the interfaces) we need to decide the
Java/TypeScript types to be used for the primitive properties in the LionWeb Meta-Metamodel.

- How do we represent "number", "date", "string", "boolean", "integer"?
- In Java, in TypeScript, in ...?

E.g. for Date in Java there are multiple options, but we need to choose a specific one,
even though other representations  might be better fit for some clients.
Do we use _int_ or _BigInt_ or anything else for _integer_?
Or should we use string with a specified format?

Do we want to define a mapping to a non-standard datatype?
Like in TypeScript using js-jodatime for date, or BigNumber for numbers?
Since JavaScript/TypeScript lacks any standardization, it is not easy to make a choice.
Do we want to depend on other libraries that might change and/or disappear at any moment?

If we want to keep it really interoperable, we should use the same representation in java/TypeScript as in the
Data Interchange Meta-Metamodel, for example use a string formatted as ISO 8601 for Date.
The same might be done for all other primitive types, as that is the way they are defined in the JSON that comes in/out of the API.

As the types to be used to represent properties in a programming language might depend on the functionality of the client,
it might be better to provide the supporting tools (as proposed in the previous section) parameterized with a mapping for each primitive type.
That allows clients to tune their implementation to their needs.

Another question is whether we should have an abstract programming API, which can be implemented in different languages,
or instead have language specific APIs.
For example Java and TypeScript are quite different and often use different idioms.
To make such an API seamlessly usable the programming APIs might need to be language specific.

=== Implementable Meta-metamodel
Inm principle a Data Interchange Meta-Metamodel is independent of any programming language.
For pragmatic reasons, the constructs we define in the Data Interchange Meta-Metamodel should be implementable relatively straight forward in common programming languages.
E.g. purely for data interchange, we might not need interfaces, but could use multiple inheritance between concept.
However, doing this would make a mapping to a Programming Meta-Metamodel for languages like Java, TypeScript, etc. quite hard,
so we should probably not make such a choice, but instead use interfaces and single inheritance in the Data Interchange Meta-Metamodel.
