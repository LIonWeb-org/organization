===== Example of an Interface Implementation in Kotlin

As an example of why Interfaces are useful to have, we can see a possible implementation in Kotlin, where we have a Interface mapped to an interface and a Concept map to a Class.

[source, kotlin]
----
/** An entity that can have a name */
interface PossiblyNamed {
  /** The optional name of the entity. */
  val name: String?
}

/** An entity which has a name. */
interface Named : PossiblyNamed {
  /** The mandatory name of the entity. */
  override val name: String
}

abstract class Constant(
  override val name: String,
  override val keywords: List<Keyword>,
  override var position: Position? = null
) : DataDefinition(name, keywords, position), Named
----

In this case we can easily have the `Constant` combine `DataDefinition` and `Named`.
This approach does not require any code generation (the <<Concept>> and <<Interface>> could be obtained from the `Class` and `Interface` definition through reflection).
