# Logo variants

* `logo.svg` contains the LionWeb logo with text as text, i.e. accurate rendering relies on font "Arial Heavy" being available. It also contains a hidden layer of the same graphics as path, so it can be rendered without the font.
* `logo-path.svg` is a stripped down version of `logo.svg` with only the path graphics.
* `logo-path-white.svg` is the same as `logo-path.svg`, but with white foreground.
* `logo-title.svg` is an extension of `logo.svg` also containing text "LIONWEB" at the bottom in font "Bahnschrift Bold Condensed".
* `logo-title-path.svg` is a stripped down version of `logo-title.svg` symmetric to `logo-path.svg`.
