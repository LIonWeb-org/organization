= Documentation Structure

Let's keep https://github.com/LionWeb-io/specification/[the `specification` repo] for ourselves.

Top-level = https://github.com/LionWeb-io/[GitHub organization] = https://github.com/LionWeb-io/.github[in this repo], starting at the `README`:

* (https://github.com/LionWeb-io/specification/issues/106[issue #106]) Aim of LionWeb (most of the current `README`, as it is now)
* (https://github.com/LionWeb-io/specification/issues/107[issue #107]) Summary of core concepts and their relations (from the reference architecture) - just to build up an initial mental model
* (https://github.com/LionWeb-io/specification/issues/108[issue #108]) Use cases - currently https://github.com/LionWeb-io/specification/blob/meinte/use-case/documentation/use-cases.adoc[here]
* (https://github.com/LionWeb-io/specification/issues/109[issue #109]) Roadmap (of sorts, non-committal)
* (https://github.com/LionWeb-io/specification/issues/110[issue #110]) Contributing - how to contribute to this initiative (issues, PRs, etc.)
* How-to guides
** (https://github.com/LionWeb-io/specification/issues/111[issue #111]) Implementations (- each implementation should have their own, short “Getting started” in their respective `README`):
*** https://github.com/LionWeb-io/lionweb-typescript[TypeScript] (JavaScript)
*** https://github.com/LionWeb-io/lioncore-java[Java]
*** https://github.com/LionWeb-io/lionweb-mps[MPS]
*** C#?
*** Kotlin?
** (https://github.com/LionWeb-io/specification/issues/112[issue #112]) How to create a metamodel
(Would be cool to have a Freon implementation of LionCore at this point, running in the browser.)
** (https://github.com/LionWeb-io/specification/issues/113[issue #113]) How to use the API (bulk mode)
** (https://github.com/LionWeb-io/specification/issues/114[issue #114]) How to deserialize a *Model*
** (https://github.com/LionWeb-io/specification/issues/115[issue #115]) How to serialize a *Model*
** (https://github.com/LionWeb-io/specification/issues/116[issue #116]) How to implement model queries as a *Derived model* using a *Processor*
** (https://github.com/LionWeb-io/specification/issues/117[issue #117]) How to evolve a metamodel
** (https://github.com/LionWeb-io/specification/issues/118[issue #118]) How to implement a type system
* Explanation
** (https://github.com/LionWeb-io/specification/issues/119[issue #119]) How do references work
** (https://github.com/LionWeb-io/specification/issues/120[issue #120]) How does language reuse work (This should also showcase things like the diamond problem and such.)
*** Referencing
*** Embedding
*** _Extension_
*** (Reuse)
*** What does a “typical” multi-language architecture look like (Would be good to have a worked-out example for this)
* Reference
** (https://github.com/LionWeb-io/specification/issues/121[issue #121]) Working principles
** (https://github.com/LionWeb-io/specification/issues/122[issue #122]) Layering: data interchange “vs.” programmatic
** (https://github.com/LionWeb-io/specification/issues/123[issue #123]) Reference architecture - currently in both the top-level README and in https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_dsGs6RxcFEuTfnKmTDckllOLqzhsvwfKvmCZThBexs/edit#heading=h.j4l4qci8q98p[this GDoc]

** (https://github.com/LionWeb-io/specification/issues/126[issue #126]) Model correctness - currently https://github.com/LionWeb-io/specification/blob/meinte/correctness/documentation/correctness.adoc[here]
** (https://github.com/LionWeb-io/specification/issues/127[issue #127]) API (bulk mode) - currently https://github.com/LionWeb-io/specification/blob/main/lioncore/repo-access-api.adoc[here]

Additional remarks on the “Getting started” part:

* It'd be good if documentation had a certain level of “liveness” e.g. through the use of https://blocks.githubnext.com/[GitHub Blocks].
* Be able to switch between GPL (TypeScript, Java, C#?).

Plan:

* [&#10003;] Make an issue for every item above (and link to the issue in the list above)
* [&hellip;] Reorder according to _usefulness to a new reader_
* [&hellip;] Have a look at the https://diataxis.fr/[Diátaxis] framework for additional inspiration and guidance
* Make the `organization` repo public, but readonly (including the Issues section) for outsiders
* Use the issues to organize the work
** Use PRs when/where it makes sense
** Edit PRs directly to give feedback
